Listen
Your skin reflects your health. It's your body's canvas and one of its most valuable assets. For good skin care, start developing healthy habits that guard your valued possession from outer (and inner) forces. It's the only skin you'll ever get, so your daily habits mean everything. Here are some basic skin care tips:

Clean and moisturize your skin daily. Wash your face twice daily -- once in the morning and once at night before going to bed. After you cleanse your skin, follow with a toner and moisturizer. Toners help to remove fine traces of oil, dirt, and make-up that you may have missed when cleansing. Moisturizing is necessary even for people with oily skin. Buy a moisturizer that is best suited for your skin type (dry, normal, or oily).
