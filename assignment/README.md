# Save the Animal

## 1. Install node.js and npm:

https://nodejs.org/en/


## 2. Install dependencies:

Navigate to the cloned repo's directory.

Run:

```npm install``` 



## 3. Run the development server:

Run:

```npm start```

This will run a server so you can run the game in a browser. It will also start a watch process, so you can change the source and the process will recompile and refresh the browser automatically.

To run the game, open your browser and enter http://localhost:3000 into the address bar.


## Build for deployment:

Run:

```npm run deploy```

This will optimize and minimize the compiled bundle.
